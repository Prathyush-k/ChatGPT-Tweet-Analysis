# ChatGPT-Tweet-Analysis
#### **Current Status: Project Planning**

## Objective
The objective of this GitHub repository is to explore and analyze the usage of ChatGPT through sentiment analysis, visualization, and topic modeling techniques. The goal is to gain insights into how ChatGPT is being used and what people are saying about it on Twitter. Additionally, we aim to identify which professions are utilizing ChatGPT the most.

## Dataset
We will utilize a combination of existing data from Kaggle and data obtained through the Twitter API. By combining these sources, we aim to create a comprehensive dataset that includes a diverse range of tweets related to our research topic.
